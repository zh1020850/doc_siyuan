A simple template for TODO management.

- Daily Todo

  - Ideal for use with Daily Note, insert it to write today's to-do list and view the unfinished "Daily Todo" in the past.
  - Highly recommended to **use with Callout plugin** for better display experience!
  - Note: The new todo list created by the template has a customized `daily-todo` attribute for easy searching, so please don't delete the default todo list, otherwise it may not be searched by the "Unfinished" block!
